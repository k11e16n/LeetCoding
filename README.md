# LeetCoding

Welcome to my Leetcode journey notes! This repository is where I document my problem-solving process, including the ideas, difficulties, and lessons learned for each problem I tackle.

I'll be following the category guide on this [site](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master?tab=readme-ov-file "《代码随想录》LeetCode 刷题攻略") to practice various problems systematically.

## Warm up
There is a course on the leetcode official website [Link](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/), it is a great start for beginning my leetcoding.

There are six easy problems to start with, which I have organized into a folder named LeetCodeBeginnerGuide/. No README.md is needed for this folder because the problems are straightforward.
